## Overview
This project presents a scalable and efficient peer-to-peer system built with Java RMI, Spring Boot, and Swing. Features like file partitioning, edge computing, and Docker containerization improve performance and portability. The system serves as a reusable service for distributed tasks, with future enhancements planned for security, fault tolerance, and collaborative peerÂ interaction.

## Project Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository


```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataScience-ArtificialIntelligence/CardioVascular_Disease_Detection.git
```

### Step 2: Build the project
```bash
mvn clean install
``` 

### Step 3: Running the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 4: Start Peer Clients
```bash
java "-Djava.security.policy=client.policy" -cp "target/p2p-file-sharing-1.0.jar;target/classes" com.p2p.client.PeerClient Peer1
``` 
Replace Peer1 with different peer names for additional clients (e.g., Peer2, Peer3).

For Linux/Mac users, use colons instead of semicolons for the classpath separator:

```bash
java "-Djava.security.policy=client.policy" -cp "target/p2p-file-sharing-1.0.jar:target/classes" com.p2p.client.PeerClient Peer1
```
